# steam-url-generator
A python script that finds 3 char or longer steam urls

I used this in 2020 to find my steam profile url: https://steamcommunity.com/id/5bw/

I recently checked and found out that all 50616 are currently taken so I'm releasing my script publicly. You might get lucky if you keep running this and find one that's not taken.
This will send the steam url to discord so you will need a webhook. I personally prefer matrix over discord but its not like nearly as many people use that.


### Usage:
```
Edit the steamid.py file and put your discord webhook in there where it tells you to
Python3 and python3-pip must be installed on the computer you are going to be running this one
```
### Install requirements
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```
### Run script
```
python3 steamid.py

Windows uses py usually instead of python3
```
